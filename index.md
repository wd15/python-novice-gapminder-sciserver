This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python 3 for people with little or no previous
programming experience. It uses plotting as its motivating example and is designed to be used in
both [Data Carpentry][dc-lessons] and [Software Carpentry][swc-lessons] workshops.
This lesson references [JupyterLab][jupyterlab] but can be taught using alternative Python 3 interpreters
as well (e.g., repl.it, Anaconda).
